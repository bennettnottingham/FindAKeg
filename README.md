# Project Description: FindAKeg

## Overview
FindAKeg is a web application that provides keg and beer recommendations based on gathered ratings and data from various sources. The platform is specifically designed to help restaurants and breweries efficiently find top-rated kegs that meet their customers' preferences. By simplifying the keg selection process and providing valuable data on keg prices, availability, and beer ratings, FindAKeg aims to revolutionize the way draft-beer serving businesses acquire kegs, making it more cost-effective and time-efficient.

## Problem Statement
In the world of beer serving businesses, the process of buying kegs has been identified as inefficient and time-consuming. Currently, businesses must individually approach each brewery or beer seller to purchase kegs, leading to excessive effort and expenses. There is also a lack of centralized data on keg prices, availability, and customer ratings, making it challenging for businesses to make informed decisions about their keg selections.

## Solution
FindAKeg will address these challenges by providing a user-friendly platform that aggregates data from various sources to provide keg and beer recommendations. The platform will offer keg price data, availability, and beer ratings for specific beer types, empowering businesses to make data-driven decisions about the kegs they wish to purchase.

## Key Features
1. **Keg Price Data:** The platform will gather accurate and up-to-date keg pricing data by directly contacting distributors, enabling businesses to make informed choices based on their budget constraints.

2. **Beer Ratings:** FindAKeg will aggregate beer ratings from various sources, helping businesses understand the popularity and quality of different beer types.

3. **Centralized Data Storage:** All data, including keg prices, availability, and beer ratings, will be stored in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio for secure and centralized data storage.

4. **Local Chrome Browser Hosting:** The web application will be hosted on a local Chrome browser, allowing easy access and interaction for users.

## Technology Stack
- Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup and Selenium will be used for data extraction from various sources.
- Data Analysis: Python will be employed for data processing and aggregating beer ratings.
- Database: Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio will host the SQL Server instance for centralized data storage.
- Front-End: A user-friendly web interface will be built and hosted on a local Chrome browser for easy access.
